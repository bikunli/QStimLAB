# STABLAB
This repository is a package for simulating qubit stabilizer group on MATLAB.
Features:
- Performing Clifford unitary operations on a stabilizer group
- Performing Single-qubit and multi-qubit Pauli measurements
- Determining the relationship between two stabilizer groups
- Determining the subsystem entropy of a stabilizer state
- Performing partial trace, kron product, et al.
